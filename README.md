 Overview of a Simple Java Calculator Program

As part of my recent project, I developed a simple calculator in Java. This basic application is designed to perform fundamental arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Below is a quick overview of how the program works:

ðŸ”§ Key Components:
User Input Handling:

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
It then asks the user to choose an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /).
Operation Execution:

Based on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding operation.
A switch-case structure is used to manage different operations, ensuring clean and organized code.
Result Display:

The program outputs the result of the calculation.
It also includes basic error handling, such as preventing division by zero.
